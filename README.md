# Intro_Telecoms_2020
Semester Project for Intro to Telecommunications course, 5th Semester 2020 of the Electrical and Computer Engineering School at the National Technical University of Athens.

In this project we implemented basic signal processing ideas such as:

* Sampling
* Uniform Quantization
* BPAM and QPSK modulation
* AWGN Noise
* Constellation Diagrams
* Calculation of Bit Error Rate
* De-quantization and Reconstruction of original signal
 
 The above actions were demonstrated on a text file as well as a sound file.
